## Service offerings expressed with Orchestra

Orchestra is a standard developed by the [FIX Trading Community](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/). It was conceived to provide machine readable rules of engagement for counterparties. Machine readable rules avoid ambiguities and gaps prevalent in narrative specifications and may be directly processed by users to generate code, configurations, test cases, and so forth.

The purpose of this project is to collect machine readable rules, conformant to the Orchestra standard, for various service offerings. We encourage service providers to contribute Orchestra files here.

When an Orchestra file has not been provided by a party offering a service (We hope they see the benefits and do so in the future!), participants of this project have interpreted their textual specifications into an Orchestra file. In that case, be forewarned that we are not the original designers of the system, and it is possible that we may have misinterpreted their intent due to the aforementioned ambiguities. Use at your own risk.
